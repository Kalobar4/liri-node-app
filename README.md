## Summary
The main functionality is contained within liri.js and centers around a main function with 5 call backs.  The main function routes the user's media request to movie, song, concert or random requests to remote servers for select data.  Async issues are addressed through promise/catch resolution, and results are both logged to console as well as logged in a separate log.txt file as an append.fs command.
